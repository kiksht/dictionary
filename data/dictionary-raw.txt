- -’adau [n] fond of, crazy about, favorite thing
Examples: Ich-’adau i’Ålenchish. “I’m fond of oranges, I just love oranges.” I¬ka-’adau i¬gui. “She’s fond of rasp- berries, she just loves raspberries.” [GT, MMc]
Notes: The initial prefix on this word agrees with the initial prefix on the word naming the thing liked. The possessive prefix refers to the person who likes the thing named. For ex- ample: I-cha-’adau i-gunat “She’s fond of salmon”
Notes: Clearly related to Warm Springs word Åtau. When the possessive prefix is a single consonant, there occurs with this word the sequence consonant+glottal stop, which other- wise is not known to occur in Wasco. (In Wasco, a glottal stop normally occurs either at the beginning of a word or between vowels, but not after another consonant.) Hence, it is almost certain that this word was borrowed from Warm Springs to Wasco rather than the other way around.

Notes: If a woman is pulling a log by a rope, one would say: giu¬adat. But of the rope pulling at the log, one would say: chixgat. If a man is pull- ing a rope that is tied to a wall, then one would say: chixgat “he (the man) is pulling at it (the rope).” [Dyk] The idea, here, then seems to be that this verb refers to pulling or tugging at something, against resistance, rather than simply pulling something along. Note also that with suffix -t, this verb means “have something pulled taut” and hence can mean “hold, hold taut.”

it-kˆkikw¬ [n] lunch
Examples: Dixlukw¬t idiaxˆkikw¬. “He is taking his lunch along.” [Dyk]
Notes: Dyk specifies that this refers to “lunch taken along,” while Hiram Smith [7/27/56] defines it as “any kind of lunch.” Perhaps the word took on a more general meaning between the time Dyk wrote (early 1930s) and 1956. However, Gladys Thompson and Madeline McInturff [6/4/98] say this refers specifically to lunch or other meal packed along.

-k’ani [n] white person [Dyk, SW 3/ 22/52, HS 7/27/54], non-Wasco, non-Nadidanwit [PK 6/29/56], story, legend, character (of person)

Notes: The noun stem -k’ani has a variety of meanings. Its original meaning appears to have been “natu- ral way” or “story;” then it came to be used of white people through a process that is not entirely clear. When used with the prefix i- it usu- ally has the meaning “white man,” but may also mean “story, legend” or “character (of a person).” When used with the prefix a-, it always now means “white woman.” The forms itk’anyuksh and i¬k’anyuks mean “white persons.” Otherwise, when used with the prefix it-, it means “people’s ways,” usually “Indian ways” or “ancient (Indian) ways;” see it-k’ani. It also usually has that mean- ing when used with the initial prefix i- and the possessive prefix -¬a- (“their”), to form i¬ak’ani; but i¬ak’ani may also refer to white people’s ways.

Undoubtedly we are dealing here with a number of different roots which happen to sound alike. Since some of the stems formed with this root are difficult to assign to one or another of the possible basic mean- ings of this set of roots, they are simply listed below in the usual al- phabetical order.

-LA [vb] train, exercise, practice
Forms: ch¬ula “he is training them” ch¬igilat “he is training them for him” ixlÅ “he is training (himself)” [Dyk] anxlaya “I will train (myself)” [PK 6/18/56]
Notes: This may be simply a variant meaning and usage of the root -la- “sharpen.” More likely, it should be regarded as an additional meaning of -la “move.”









-LA [vb] move (boat), boat
Forms: ch¬ulat “he is moving it (boat), he is boating” ch¬ulalal “he is moving it (boat) about, he is boating about” ch¬igilat “he is moving it (boat) towards him; he is moving them towards him” chaigilat “he has it[a-] anchored to it[i-]; he is moving it[a-] towards it[i-]” nigilat “I am moving it[i-] (boat) towards him; I am going after him with a boat” inigila “I moved it[i-] (boat) towards him” emshgingidla “you folks brought it[i-] (boat) over for me” niyamgidla “I brought it[i-] over for you (last week)” niniagidla “I brought it[i-]/him (boat, or in boat) over for her (last week)” ninigidla “I brought it[i-]/him over for him (last week)” nichˆngidla “he brought it[i-] over for me (last week)” ninigila “I brought it[i-]/him over for him (last season)” chai©ilaq¬qt “he is moving it[a-] away from him” [Dyk]

Notes: This verb is constructed in two different ways. When used sim- ply in the sense “hit,” both the thing hitting and the thing or person hit are expressed by neutral pronouns; the second pronoun is object of the relational prefix -l- (which often appears in its alternate form -i-). When used to mean “hit with,” the person or thing hitting is expressed with an active pronoun, the person or thing hit with a neutral pronoun, and the thing with which the person or thing is hit is expressed with a neutral pronoun which is the object of the relational prefix -l- (which likewise often appears in its alternate form -i-). Always in the first construc- tion and usually in the second con- struction, this verb refers to being hit unintentionally or accidentally, not on purpose.

-x-LA-q¬q [vb] open, open for
Forms: construction 1: achÅxlaq¬qa “he will open it[a-] [referring to waskÅn ‘box’]” [WTI.9.11] naxlalq¬q “I am opening it[a-] (box, can)” chaxlalq¬q “he is opening it[a-]” chixlalq¬q “he is opening it[i-] (as taking off a lid)” chuxwalalq¬q “he is opening them/it (for instance, a house)” chuxÅlaq¬qt “he has it/them open, has opened it/them, is leaving it/them open” chixlaq¬qt “he has it[i-] open, has opened it, is leaving it open” ichaxlaq¬q “he opened it[a-] (box)” nichixlaq¬q “he opened it[i-]” nichixlalq¬q “he was opening it[i-] (several times or several things)” gachaxlaq¬q “he opened it[a-]; he opened it[a-] for her” nichixlaq¬qam “he went to open it[i- ]” nichixatlaq¬qam “he came to open it[i-]” gachixlaq¬qam “he went to open it[i-]” gachixat¬aq¬qam “he came to open it[i-]” chanxlaq¬q “he is opening it[a-] for me” chiuxwalalq¬q “he is opening it[i-] for them, he is opening it which belongs to them” chaixlalq¬q “he is opening it[a-] (door, box) for him” ichaixlaq¬q “he opened it[a-] for him” gachaixlaq¬q “he opened it[a-] for him” gachiuxalaq¬q “he opened it[i-] for them” gachuxalaq¬q “he opened them for themselves; he opened it[a-] for them” construction 2: anxlalq¬q “I am open- ing it[a-] (door)” [GT wanted to sub- stitute naxlalq¬q] aixlaq¬q “he is opening it[a-]” [interpreted as im- perative by GT 12/29/97] igaixlaq¬q “he opened it[a-]” ixlÅq¬qix “it[i-] (lid, package) has been opened” aixlÅq¬qix “it[a-] belonging to him has been opened, it has been opened for him” [last three forms recognized by GT 12/29/97] [Dyk]
Notes: This verb can apparently be constructed two ways: with an active subject pronoun and a neutral pro- noun as direct object (construction 1), or with neutral pronouns express- ing both subject and object (con- struction 2); in the latter case, the first pronoun expresses the agent (the one doing the opening), and the second one, which expresses the object opened, is, gramatically, the object of the relational -x. Construc- tion 1 is apparently more common.

-a-k-LA-qw [vb] steer
Forms: chaiglÅlq “he is steering him” aixlÅlq “he is steering” aixlÅqwt “he is steering” aixadlalq “he was steer- ing” igaixlÅq “he steered” [Dyk] Notes: Apparently refers to steering a boat with paddle or oar.

Examples: LablÅp ikiax. “It[i-] is boil- ing.” Lablap chiuxt i©iwaq. “He is boiling the meat.” [Dyk]

i-lablish [n] hoe
See also: i-labiush

i-lablit [n] bridle
Notes: Phillip Kahclamat [8/11/54] said this word was from Chinook Jargon and was no longer used. He pronounced it -lablˆt and did not give a prefix. Hiram Smith 7/2/56 said the word was “Lower Wasco” (prob- ably Clackamas?). The word is from French (almost certainly via Chinook Jargon); the original French word is la bride; in the transition to Jargon and Wasco, the r became -l-, as the nearest sound available in Wasco.

a-lachemni [n] chimney
Notes: Though this word sounds like English “chimney,” the -la- shows that it was borrowed from the French word la cheminé, almost certainly via Chinook Jargon. The French -ch- usually represents the “sh” sound, so the -ch- in this word may reflect English influence, or else a dialectical French pronunciation. Compare a- lashmni.
See also: a-lashmni

i-ladÅm [n] table
Forms: i¬ladam “tables” [GT, MMc]
Notes: Related to Warm Springs latÅam. Both probably borrowed from French through Chinook Jar- gon.
