- -’adau [n] fond of, crazy about, favorite thing
Examples: Ich-’adau i’Ålenchish. “I’m fond of oranges, I just love oranges.” I¬ka-’adau i¬gui. “She’s fond of rasp- berries, she just loves raspberries.” [GT, MMc]
Notes: The initial prefix on this word agrees with the initial prefix on the word naming the thing liked. The possessive prefix refers to the person who likes the thing named. For ex- ample: I-cha-’adau i-gunat “She’s fond of salmon”
Notes: Clearly related to Warm Springs word Åtau. When the possessive prefix is a single consonant, there occurs with this word the sequence consonant+glottal stop, which other- wise is not known to occur in Wasco. (In Wasco, a glottal stop normally occurs either at the beginning of a word or between vowels, but not after another consonant.) Hence, it is almost certain that this word was borrowed from Warm Springs to Wasco rather than the other way around.
